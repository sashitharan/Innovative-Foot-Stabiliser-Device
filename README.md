Aim/Objective of your invention 

This aim of this  project involves a design and development of a device that helps aid nurses or doctors to be able to create a strain free environment while carrying out the Podiatry Treatment and also creating solutions for the patients accurately; preventing and possibly making minimal human error.


Why the need for such invention? 	

Existing products in the market fail to provide a decent dorsiflexion to the feet by itself as a machine. The doctors or podiatry practitioners have to provide dorsiflexion to the feet in order to do the treatment with ease and also providing minimal human error. Thus causing Overuse injuries such as strain, wrist pain, arm ache, wrist strains caused when holding the feet in position for very long and lastly injuries or strains on the hands as the doctors will have to apply pressure on the spot where the surgery needs to take place and most of the time patients tend to move about when pain is felt.
